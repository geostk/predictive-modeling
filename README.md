# predictive-modeling
these scripts are intended to do the following:
* sample a set of raster images at the locations of ground reference points
* train a predictive model using the sampled raster data as predictors
* predict a response variable for a larger area where raster data is available
* plot the accuracy of the model using beanplots
* plot variable importance of the used predictors
* save the resulting response variable prediction maps to geotiff
